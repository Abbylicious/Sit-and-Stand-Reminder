# Sit-and-Stand-Reminder

A simple app that reminds you to alternate between standing and sitting every 40 and 20 minutes, respectively.

If you're using Windows 10, right click on the action center on the far-right of the taskbar and turn off focus assist. That way the notifications can get through while playing games, one of the best times to have these notifications on your side!

Can be added to Windows startup.
